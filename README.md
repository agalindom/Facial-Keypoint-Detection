# Overview
- CNN model built in PyTorch that performs Facial Keypoint Detection for Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree.

# Description  
1. Defined a CNN with images as input and facial keypoints as output.
2. Constructed a PyTorch Dataset with the [Youtube faces Dataset](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/ytfaces/FaceKeypointsDataset).
3. Trained the CNN on the training data.
4. Performed examples to show how the trained model performs on test data.
